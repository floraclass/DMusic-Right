# Decentralized Music Rights Marketplace

A blockchain-based platform built on Stacks that revolutionizes how music royalties are managed, distributed, and traded through fractional NFT ownership and smart contract automation.

## üéµ Project Overview

The music industry has long struggled with opaque royalty distribution, delayed payments, and complex rights management. Our decentralized marketplace solves these problems by tokenizing music royalties into fractional NFTs, enabling transparent revenue sharing and creating new investment opportunities for fans and investors.

## üöÄ Core Features

### 1. Fractional Ownership ‚úÖ **(Currently Implemented)**
- Artists can mint up to 1000 NFTs per song, each representing a percentage of future streaming royalties
- Flexible share distribution (e.g., 1000 NFTs √ó 0.1% = 100% of royalties)
- Transparent ownership tracking on the blockchain
- Immediate proof of ownership and revenue rights

### 2. Oracle Integration **(Coming Soon)**
- Trusted oracle system for submitting periodic revenue reports
- Integration with major streaming platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.)
- Automated revenue data validation and processing
- Multi-source revenue aggregation

### 3. Automatic Distribution **(Coming Soon)**
- Smart contract holds revenue in STX or stablecoins
- NFT holders can claim their proportional share at any time
- Gas-efficient batch distribution mechanisms
- Real-time revenue tracking and analytics

### 4. Secondary Market **(Coming Soon)**
- Full marketplace for trading royalty NFTs
- Automatic rights transfer upon sale
- Price discovery mechanisms
- Liquidity pools for fractional shares
